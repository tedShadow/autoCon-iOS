## Issues

- input lag, the wireless connection may have some affect on long time macro recording and replaying. use a lightning to ethernet cable will help.
- no L3, R3 support (I am thinking use force touch)

## Credits

The idea was make iphone works as a nintendo switch pro controller that could record macro and play macro easily.
